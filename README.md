# Quick Save

[中文版 (Chinese Version)](README_CN.md)

An efficient Photoshop UXP plugin focused on quick saving and overwriting documents. It records your "Save As" history and allows you to overwrite save the current document to a history path with a simple double-click.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **💾 Save As & Record**: Save documents via the plugin's "Save As" button to automatically record file paths and thumbnails.
*   **⚡ Quick Overwrite**: **Double-click** a thumbnail in the history list to overwrite save the current open document to that location.
*   **🖼️ High-Performance Thumbnails**: Uses a local caching mechanism to generate 128x128 HD thumbnails, loading quickly without bloating document size.
*   **🌍 Multi-language Support**: Interface automatically adapts to Photoshop language settings (supports English and Simplified Chinese).
*   **🔒 Permission Management**: Smartly manages file write permissions, displaying status via visual indicators (green dot in top-left corner).
*   **🎨 Compact Interface**: Compact UI designed for professional workflows, supporting dark mode.

### 2. Quick Overwrite
When you need to update the current document to a history version:
*   Find the target file in the list.
*   **Double-click** the thumbnail.
*   After confirming the prompt, the current document will directly overwrite the target file.

### 3. Manage History

## 📝 Notes

*   **Overwrite is Irreversible**: Double-click overwrite save will directly replace the original file, please operate with caution.
*   **Permission Indicator**: If a green dot appears in the top-left of the thumbnail, the plugin currently has write permission for that file; if not, permission may be requested again upon overwrite.
*   **Cache Cleanup**: Deleting history records automatically cleans up the corresponding local thumbnail cache files to keep the system clean.
